# Hotel Booking Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the booking information of a hotel over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of number of booking and cancellation data, we seek to identify and gain a deeper understanding of the hotels revenue through guests.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "hotel_bookings.csv", containing detailed information about each booking and cancellation in the hotel.

### Tools
  - Excel - Data cleaning and represantation [Download here](https://microsoft.com)

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data prepation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

 - What is the overall booking?
 - Which is the overall cancellation?
 - What are the type of hotel in number?

### Results/Findings

1. The hotels's bookings have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.    
2. Singles are the one who doesn't cancel most of the time

### Limitations

I had to remove all unnecessary columns because they would not have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis.
